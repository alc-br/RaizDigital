"""
Initialize the FastAPI application package.

This file marks the ``app`` directory as a Python package.  It does not
implement any functionality but exists so that modules can be imported
from ``app`` using dotted notation.  Keeping this file minimal helps
prevent any sideâ€“effects when the package is imported.
